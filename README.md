💫 About Me:
**` Mechatronics Engineering Student `**

🙋🏽‍♂️Hi! I'm Muzzammil Rehman<br><br>I am a Mechatronics Engineering Student @ Ontario Tech University🏫, and with a strong passion for robotics and electromechanical systems I hope to one day apply the knowledge I have gained to leave a lasting and positive impact on the world🌏.<br><br>Specifically, I am passionate about electrical/circuit design (PCB, VLSI, and ASIC)💡, control systems and embedded software 🖥️, as well as machine learning and computer vision. I enjoy bridging the gap between hardware and software. Currently seeking a summer 2025 internship :D.<br><br>I currently have extensive experience with the Arduino microcontroller, as well as with C++, C#, and Java (a strong catalog for 3D design with SolidWorks and Sketch-Up as well). I am currently in the process of learning Python so I can dive deeper into machine learning and computer vision, as well as I am also starting to create projects with the STM32 Nucleo and ESP32 microcontrollers to expand my knowledge and familiarize myself with ARM🦾 and other architectures.

Feel free to take a look around!!
